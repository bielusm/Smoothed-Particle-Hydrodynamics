# Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics

This is a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics fluid simulator that I made for a school project in my graphics class. 
Most of the code is written by me with some assistance from my teacher. Algorithms have been implemented from the research paper SPH fluids in computer graphics by M. Ihmsen, J. Orthmann, S. Barbara, A. Kolb and M. Teschner. It can be found here http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/egst.20141034.021-042.
